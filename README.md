Frontend Portfolio
===
A personal design based on various web references, focused on responsive design. In this project, I applied my new skills in React.js and Tailwind CSS to create a simple yet functional interface.

This is a React 18 project built with Vite. It provides a fast and optimized development environment for building modern web applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (npm comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ``` bash
      npm install
      # or
      yarn install
    ```
## Development
To start the development server with Vite:
  ``` bash
      npm run dev
      # or
      yarn dev
  ```
This will start a local development server and open the project in your default browser. Vite's hot module replacement (HMR) will automatically reload the page when you make changes.

## Building for Production
To build the project for production:

  ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
  ```
This will bundle the application into static files for production in the dist directory.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React 18 - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
